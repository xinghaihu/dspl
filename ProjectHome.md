**DSPL** stands for **Dataset Publishing Language**. It is a representation format for both the _metadata_ (information about the dataset, such as its name and provider, as well as the concepts it contains and displays) and actual _data_ (the numbers) of datasets. Datasets described in this format can be imported into the [Google Public Data Explorer](http://www.google.com/publicdata), a tool that allows for rich, visual exploration of the data.

This site hosts miscellaneous, open source content (i.e., schemas, example files, and utilities) associated with the DSPL standard. See our [documentation site](http://code.google.com/apis/publicdata) for more details on what DSPL is and how to use it.
